# Account manager

> two types of accounts: user and admin

- Design an interface for each, given that users have email, password and isActive properties, and admins additionally have an adminSince property, which is of type Date.
- export these interfaces from account-manager.ts moudle as IUser and IAdmin
- Update the Account manager class you have been given, such that any mismatching is caught by the Typescript compiler at build time.
